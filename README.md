# GreatStuff
Useful framework that encapsulates some boilerplate code to ease my coding life.

## Usage
After addition of new useful great stuff into the project, to build new framework version simply build the `Build framework` target. The resulting file is going to be sitting in the Destop directory, which is pretty convinient for dropping it into the working project.
